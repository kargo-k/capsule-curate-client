      <h1>About Capsule Curate: Less is More</h1>
      <p>
        Capsule Curate is a tool for building and visualizing your own capsule wardrobe, which is a minimalist technique for tidying your closet and honing in on your personal style.
      </p>

      <h1>What is a Capsule Wardrobe?</h1>
      <p>
        Capsule Wardrobes are pretty much a minified wardrobe made up of extremely versatile pieces that can mix and match with each other to maximize the number of outfit combinations.  They typically have about 35 or so items, which are the only clothes that you wear for a specific season.  Because capsules have a limited number of items, this helps you to choose articles that you truly enjoy wearing.  No more feeling guilty about wearing that expensive top that you bought on a whim but turns out it's not particularly flattering.

      <h1>About Capsule Curate</h1>
      <p>
        Capsule Curate is a tool for building and visualizing your own capsule wardrobe, which is a technique for honing in on your personal style so that you can wear clothing that you enjoy wearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capsules typically have between 30-35 items of clothing, which are the only clothes that you wear for a specific season.  Because capsules have a limited number of items, this helps you to choose articles that you truly enjoy wearing.  No more feeling guilty about wearing that expensive top that you don't actually like wearing!
